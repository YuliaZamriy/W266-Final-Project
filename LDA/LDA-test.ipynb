      " Mr. Speaker. CAFTA. the United States Central American Free Trade Agreement. is yet another unfair trade deal that will hurt American workers. CAFTA is the latest unfair trade deal in a decade of failed trade policies. Over the last 12 years. the United States trade deficit has exploded from $39 billion in 1992 to over $618 billion in 2004. If CAFTA becomes effective. the result will be fewer jobs for American workers. CAFTA is modeled on NAFTA. the North American Free Trade Agreement. which had and continues to have a devastating impacton many American workers. When NAFTA was passed in 1994. the United States had a $2 billion trade surplus with.Mexico. In 2004. we had a $45 billion trade deficit in Mexico. That means our trade deficit with Mexico increased by an average of $4.7 billion per year- over the last 10\n",

      " Madam Speaker. I rise in support of this resolution and in support of our friend and ally Israel. September 11 was a defining moment for our country. It forced Americans to confront a new reality. that terrorists \" could cause massive destruction on our soil. and that all of us are at risk. Israelis have been living with this reality for decades. Wellarmed. wellfinanced. and sophisticated terrorist organizations backed by Syria and Iran surround her. They have carried out thousands of attacks on Israeli soil. and they will stop at nothing to accomplish their one common goal: the destruction of Israel. Just as America does. Israel has a right to defend herself. Israel has a right to better security for its borders and its security and its future. A secure Israel cannot exist with Hezbollah controlling the territory directly to the north. and a secure Israel cannot exist with Hamas in control of the Palestinian Authority. Israel is at war with terrorists. and we must stand with her. We have a moral obligation to stand on the side of democracy and freedom against terror and radicalism. and we must do so because. left unchecked. -these terrorist organizations will continue to destabilize the region and will use it as a base to foster global instability and to undermine our national security. With passage of this resolution. we will send an unequivocal message to the world that terrorist organizations. Hezbollah and Hamas. backed by Iran and Syriaare responsible for this violence. that Israel has a right to defend herself. and that the United States will stand with Israel in its fight against terror. We must also do so because this conflict is not just about Israel. but it is about Americas national security. Since the 1980s. Hizballah has been behind dozens of terrorist attacks targeting western nations. including the United .States. In 1983. they killed 241 American servicemen in an attack on a military barracks in Lebanon. In 1994. they killed 86 civilians in a bombing. in Buenos Aires. Argentina. In 1996. they killed 19 U.S. airmen at a U.S. military barracks in Saudi Arabia. Left unchecked. Hizballah and these terrorist groups will continue to destabilize the region and use it as a base to foster global. instability. By passing this resolution with strong bipartisan support. we will send an unequivocal message to the worldHizballah and Hamas are responsible for this violence. Israel has a right to defend itself. and the United States will stand with Israel in its fight against terror. I am confident that Israel will prevail in this fight. And. it is my hope that their strong actions against terror will ultimately lead to the peace and security that so many in the region desperately seek.\n",

I will not abandon 2 million Americans. including 200.000 veterans. We must give them a hand up. Yesterday. I signed a discharge petition to force action on extending unemployment insurance benefits. a move supported by more than threefourths of the American people. Additionally. nationally. there are three unemployed people for each job created. For the longterm unemployed. there is just a 12 percent chance of finding a new job in any given month. Congress must extend unemployment benefits to help keep American families out of poverty as they seek jobs. Each week we fail to act. another 72.000 people lose their benefits. We must act now.\n",

      " Mr. Speaker. today. along with my Republican colleague. MELISSA HART. I am introducing the Osteoporosis Early Detection and Prevention Act of 2005. This bill will ensure that individuals at high risk for osteoporosis have access to screening tests for the disease. The legislation would require private insurance plans to cover bone mass measurement testing for those at risk for developing the disease. Osteoporosis is a disease that has -no symptoms and usually remains undiagnosed until a fracture occurs. Approximately 44 million Americans suffer from osteoporosis or are at risk of developing it. and 80 percent of those at risk are women. Every year. there are 1.5 million bone fractures caused by osteoporosis. Since there is no known cure for osteoporosis. the most effective way to reduce the prevalence and cost of the disease is through prevention and early diagnosis. As a result. bone mass measurement tests are crucial to early detection because ordinary xrays do not detect osteoporosis until the disease is so advanced that 25 to 40 percent of bone mass has been lost. Bone mass measurement is a noninvasive. painless and reliable way to diagnose osteoporosis before costly fractures occur. By ensuring that high risk individuals have access to screening tests. The Osteoporosis Early Detection and Prevention Act will make a huge difference in defending men and women from osteoporosis.\n",
