      " Mr. Speaker. February is a national celebration of the role of black Americans in all segments of life in the United States. It is a time to celebrate the achievement of blacks in every field from science and the arts to government and politics. February gives us a chance to reflect on how much black Americans have contributed to America and an opportunity to learn from the past in order to look confidently toward the future. Black history in the United States has been a proving ground for Americas ideals and this month we celebrate our nations diversity. The story of black Americans is one of valor in the face of hardship. Because of the struggles they have endured. we have become better people. Through their sacrifice. we have become a better nation. All Americans must be reminded of their undying dedication to the ideals of freedom and liberty upon which our nation was founded. Their progress throughout American history is a true testament to the reality of the American dream. Remarks E243 Understanding our past allows us to pursue a bright future as a diverse. but united nation. For this reason. I commend the deserved attention February brings to AfricanAmericans who have shaped our history and who will be an integral part of our destiny. I seek the day when the tragic side of the black legacy in America can be laid to rest once and for all and applaud black Americans for their tremendous contributions to the history of our great nation.\n",

      " Mr. Speaker. I would like to take 1 minute to discuss the recent flight of the space shuttle on mission 41C. This mission. in particular. highlights the reasons for -my enthusiasm for our Nations space program. Each time the shuttle completes another mission. we have been continually thrilled with NASAs ability to successfully complete complex and challenging activities. The recent missions have made clear the enormous potential the shuttle offers us to expand our ability to do things in space. We are using the shuttle to develop new productspharmaceuticals. alloys. semiconductors. and so forththat will someday be valuable parts of our national economy. We are using the shuttle to develop more capability to operate in space. For example. in this last mission. the long duration exposure facility was put into orbit. This project will enable us to understand must better the effects of longterm exposure in space. There are 57 experiments that mark the beginning of a broad research program in space to test new technologies that will be required for future space missions. The repair of the solar maximum mission further points out our expanding ability to operate in space. Now. not only can we launch satellites with a high rate of success. but NASA has shown that we can retrieve malfunctioning spacecraft and repair them. all without returning to Earth. But all this drama detracts from another important aspect. We are using the shuttleand our ability to perform complex activities in spaceto do the basic research that will expand our knowledge and understanding of the Earth. the Sun. and the solar system. The solar maximum spacecraft that was repaired is critical to the longterm study of the Sun. The solar maximum mission will help scientists understand how the Sun works. how solar events affect the Earths weather and communications. and the sunspot cycles. I am delighted to see that attention is now being directed to what we can and will do in spacenot simply in just getting there. This was the greatest thrill of the 41C mission this month.\n",

      " Mr. President. I join with my distinguished colleagues today in submitting this resolution in support of the resumption of the strategic arms reduction talks. With this resolution. the Senate encourages the United States and the Soviet Union to use vigorous diplomatic efforts to resolve the outstanding issues impeding progress toward the conclusion of a START Treaty. The resolution states the Senates support for a verifiable and stabilizing START agreement and urges the President to consult closely with the Senate and Americas allies as he works toward a treaty. The successful negotiation of a START Treaty that is verifiable and stabilizing must remain a high priority of the United States and I offer my full support to the Bush administration as it works to conclude such a treaty. I welcome President Bushs interest in exploring improved verification techniques and confidence building measures in conjunction with the START negotiations. I support efforts to increase confidence in our ability to verify arms control agreements and to enhance the prospects for enthusiastic Senate consent to a negotiated treaty. I am pleased by Secretary Bakers statement that the administration intends its inspection initiative to facilitate the process of resolving outstanding issues within the negotiations. It is my hope that the focus on verification will not delay the policy decisions that are necessary for concrete progress toward an actual arms control agreement. We all understand that there are several areas of disagreement between the United States and the Soviet Union in the START talks. I am hopeful that the administration will devote its energies to resolving such isues as whether to ban mobile missiles and sealaunched nuclear cruise missiles and devising counting rules for missiles carried on bombers. There is a clear need to forge a unified and creative approach to these issues at the START negotiations. I also believe that we must be realistic about the Strategic Defense Initiative and the relationship of missile defenses to strategic arms. The Joint Chiefs of Staff reportedly has suggested several options that recognize the technological and fiscal constraints upon the SDI program and the shortterm Soviet advantage in the absence of the ABM Treaty. The proposed changes were not dramatic. but they would have helped to bridge the gap between the United States and Soviet positions at the Space and Defense Talks. I hope that President Bush will consider these proposals objectively. It would be unfortunate if ideology overrode common sense and unnecessarily Jeopardized the prospects for a START agreement. I urge President Bush to clarify his position on the ABM Treaty and reevaluate the current United States position at the space talks. The United States now has a great opportunity to make significant progress in several arms control negotiations. The INF Treaty laid the groundwork for START by establishing important precedents for actual reductions of nuclear weapons and intrusive onsite inspection verification pro. cedures. The political momentum of arms control carried over into the START negotiations. in which the Reagan administration made significant progress. It would be tragic if the current administration failed to seize the opportunity to conclude a strategie arms reduction treaty to enhance the security of the United States. President Bush has demonstrated his ability to move forward forcefully in the area of conventional arms control. I am hopeful that he will demonstrate the same creativity and commitment to the pursuit of strategic arms reductions and I look forward to working in support of the Bush administrations efforts to more forward in the START negotiations. I am pleased that a senior delegation of the Senate Arms Control Observer Group will soon depart for Geneva and Vienna to consult with the United States arms control negotiators and to meet with delegations from Allied countries and the Soviet Union. This is an important step in an ongoing process of dialog and consultation between the Senate and the Executive branch regarding arms control and related strategic issues. I look forward to a strengthening of this consultative process in the best interests of the Nation.\n",

      " Mr. Speaker. I rise today in praise of a new Medicare part D prescription drug benefit that is available to all seniors beginning January 1. 2006. This week. the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid released information on organizations offering prescription drug plans in each of our 50 States. and the opportunity for signup begins November 15. This announcement holds great news for seniors across America. In every State. seniors will have a choice among plan providers. In my home State of Georgia. for example. seniors will be able to choose from 18 different plans. ensuring they can find one that best suits their individual needs. Mr. Speaker. there is more good news for our seniors. Not only will they be eligible for prescription drug coverage from a range of organizations. but they will receive this benefit for less money than previously expected. in some cases. for a premium as low as $20 a month. This is the power of competition. and our seniors will benefit from it.. We do not need government price controls. The free market works. Mr. Speaker. for years. our seniors have struggled with the rising cost of prescription drugs. in some cases going without medicine they need to stay healthy. With Medicare part D. seniors will be able to reap the benefits of preventive care and live longer. healthier lives.\n",

      " Mr. Speaker. today I am introducing the Teacher Sabbatical Leave Grants Act. Without a quality teacher in the classroom. it is impossible for us. as a nation. to provide the education our children deserve. It is essential that we ensure quality teachers are in every classroom in every school. Professional development helps ensure our teachers skills grow and change as our students grow more diverse and as our technology changes. However. our teachers will never get the indepth development training they need to stay on top of their field from oneday workshops. Recent findings have shown that 99 percent of our teachers have participated in at least one professional development activity in the past year. However only 12 percent of teachers who spent only 1 to 8 hours in professional development said it improved their teaching a lot. That is a dismal figure. We must work to provide teachers with intensive professional development. so 100 percent of teachers who receive the training feel that it improved their teaching. Without it. we will never be able to ensure our children are being taught by quality teachers. My bill will give teachers the opportunity to receive intensive professional development training. This bill creates a program to provide grants for public school teachers who take one or two semesters of sabbatical leave to pursue a course of study for professional development. The grant covers onehalf of the salary the teacher would have earned if the teacher had not been granted a leave of absence. Teachers are eligible if they have been approved for sabbatical leave and if they have enrolled in a course of study at an institution of higher education designed to improve classroom teaching. By providing teachers with financial resources. they will be free to pursue an intensive course of study that can greatly improve their teaching skills. And studies have shown that the more qualified a teacher is. the better the students performance will be. For instance. in Boston. students assigned to the most effective teachers for a year showed 18 times greater gains in reading and nearly 16 time greater gains in math than those students who were assigned to the least effective teachers. In Tennessee. similar students with 3 very effective teachers in a row scored 50 percentile points better than students who were assigned 3 very ineffective teachers in a row. All of our students deserve to achieve these same gains. By providing teachers with the opportunity to receive intensive professional development. my bill will help put more effective. qualified teachers in the classroom. I urge my colleagues to support the Teacher Sabbatical Leave Grants Act.\n",

      " Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 30. supporting the goals and ideals of National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. HIV/AIDS is having a devastating affect on the African American community. The statistics given by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are staggering. The cold numbers reveal the stunning human cost of the disease. While African Americans make up less than 13 percent of the population in the United States. they represent almost 40 percent -of the diagnosed cases of AIDS since the epidemic started. In 2003. African Americans accounted for almost 50 percent of the estimated cases diagnosed. African American women are currently the most at risk of contracting HIV/AIDS. The rate of AIDS cases among black women is 19 times higher than white women and five times the. infection rate of Latinas. The infection rate among black men. while lower. is no less troubling. In 2003. 44 percent of the AIDS cases diagnosed among men were African American males. These numbers are painful to listen to and to read. The painful realities of this world do not always make frontpage news. but this issue must be addressed. We must join together in a bipartisan. bicameral effort to eradicate this epidemic. I am pleased to join with my esteemed colleague Ms. LEE in this effort and commend her distinguished and dedicated leadership on this issue. Mr. Speaker. thousands of African Americans are suffering from HIV/AIDS. On this day. National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness and Information Day. we must make a concerted effort to ensure that education. awareness and prevention are a priority in the 109th Congress.\n",
